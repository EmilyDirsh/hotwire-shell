A number of people have written and published plugins for Hotwire.  Mostly these are at a fairly early stage of development.

# Hotwire Plugins #

## Mercurial Plugin ##

The [mercurial plugin](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~maw48/hotwire-hg/) introduces a number of commands to help with managing [Mercurial](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/) (aka hg) repositories.  There is some discussion of it in the [http://groups.google.com/group/hotwire-shell/browse\_thread/thread/dbe56cb65bc3bbb9#](announcement.md).

## Beagle Search ##

This is at a fairly early stage.  For more info, [read the discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/hotwire-shell/browse_thread/thread/f4301f1086d86222#) and [(2).py download the plugin](http://hotwire-shell.googlegroups.com/web/bsearch\).
