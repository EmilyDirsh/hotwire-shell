# Where to Ask Questions #

Hotwire is a young project, so many questions may not have been asked yet.  If you want to ask a question, the best place to do so is on the [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/hotwire-shell/topics).

# Usage Questions #

## How do I stop a command?  Why doesn't Ctrl-C work? ##

In hotwire you use Ctrl-Shift-C to send a kill signal to a command.  (Ctrl-C is used for copy, as in most other desktop applications).

## Can I start hotwire in a directory other than home? ##

Yes.  Just put the directory at the end of the command for hotwire:

` $ hotwire /path/to/dir/ `

# Other Questions #

## Why didn't you use language x, gui framework y ... ##

Basically because the original developer knew python, GTK and pygtk well.  For more information, you can read [these](http://groups.google.com/group/hotwire-shell/browse_thread/thread/067a2e2ccc99476f#) [discussions](http://groups.google.com/group/hotwire-shell/browse_thread/thread/e63c009e37e8d3aa?hl=en).
