# Summary #

I haven't personally tried running on OS X.  There are two main hurdles that have to be crossed. First, you'll need either Leopard for Python 2.5, or Python 2.4+external sqlite.  Second, you will need a working GTK+ on OS X.  That either means running X, or trying out [Native GTK+ for OS X](http://developer.imendio.com/projects/gtk-macosx).

If you are interested in trying a port, post to the [Discussion Group](http://groups.google.com/group/hotwire-shell/)!

Comments here with more information are welcome too.
