# Hotwire Development #

So you want to get started hacking on the Hotwire hypershell?  You've come to the right place.

First, take a look at the BuildingFromSubversion page to get started.

Once you have a build running, you should read the HotwireArchitecture page for an overview of how the system works.  Other important pages are CodingStyle and [Contributing](Contributing.md).

# Communication #

General discussion happens on the [Hotwire Group](http://groups.google.com/group/hotwire-shell).  For patches though, please follow [Contributing](Contributing.md).  There is also a new IRC channel, #hotwire on `irc.freenode.net`.
