      <h3>What is Hotwire?</h3>
      <p>Hotwire is an object-oriented hypershell.  It is a shell designed for systems programming (files, processes), 
         and thus it is in the same conceptual category of software as the Unix shell+terminal and Windows PowerShell.</p>
       
      <p><i>(To learn more interactively than reading background here, you could try downloading a version of Hotwire for your
          operating system and experiment with it; see the links on the left.)</i></p>
         
      <p>The goal of the Hotwire project though is to create a better systems programming shell than <b>both</b> Unix and PowerShell.  We call
         it a <i>hyper</i>-shell because Hotwire blends the concepts of a systems-oriented shell with a modern graphical user interface
         display.  It takes advantage of your desktop environment rather than being a text box.</p>
      <p>From an implementation perspective, at the heart of Hotwire is the concept of asynchronous object-oriented pipeline processing.  Layered on 
         top of this in a tightly integrated fashion is a graphical display, control and introspection system.  </p> 
      <h3>How is Hotwire better than Unix?</h3>
        <p>Considered from a modern perspective, the Unix terminal is two things.  First, it is a container for the display of human-readable Unicode text, suitable for 
        applications like the Unix shell (e.g. <tt>bash</tt>) which can run other programs that output text.  Think <tt>ls</tt> (without colors) 
        <tt>dmesg</tt>, <tt>ps</tt>, <tt>cat</tt> (on plain text files), etc.  A much smaller percentage take lines of input for a question or two.</p>

        <p>Secondarily, the Unix terminal is also a very poor GUI toolkit.  One might challenge this - how is the terminal also 
           a GUI?  Here we are defining a GUI as one whose output is not suitable to be piped into another arbitrary program.  
           Today there are few commonly used applications written for the terminal GUI.  Examples are <tt>vi</tt>, 
           <tt>mutt</tt>, <tt>man</tt>, and various others.  These programs <i>are not suitable for scripting</i>, and thus are 
           equivalent to desktop GUI applications from the perspective of a shell.</p>

        <p>With this in mind, you can now understand that Hotwire does not attempt to implement an extended terminal GUI.  However,
           because we can now assume that all system commands output plain text, the environment can be optimized for text processing,
           even better than an unintegrated Unix terminal+shell.  For example, Hotwire keeps the entire output of every command by default, 
           and allows easy interactive Firefox-style search.
        </p>
        <p>Going beyond just text processing - Hotwire implements an <i>object-oriented pipeline</i>.  
           Hotwire "builtins" such as <b>ls</b> output (Python) objects, and other builtins such as <b>filter</b> can process objects.
           Because the shell knows the type of command output, it can be optimized to display it in an intelligent way.

      <h3>How is Hotwire better than Windows PowerShell?</h3>
      
        <p>Hotwire shares a conceptual heritage with PowerShell's object-oriented underpinnings.  However, Hotwire makes a number of different design decisions,
           and the result is a very different program.  For a start, Hotwire was designed for a rich, interactive graphical interface.  While third party 
           PowerShell environments exist, the result isn't the same as if the entire system was designed for it from the start.
        </p>
        <p>Another design choice is that the Hotwire project made the decision very early not to attempt to create a full new scripting language.  Hotwire
           does have a small Unix-inspired pipeline syntax, but a major goal of the project is to make it as easy for 
           users to leverage real existing programming languages such as Python, and Ruby - as well as (where available) Unix shell script.</p>
        <p>Finally, Hotwire has a much more day-to-day system interaction feel to it than PowerShell does.  For example, Hotwire is fanatical
           about saving your history, and making it easy to find frequently used commands and directories again.  Hotwire integrates with the desktop - its builtin <b>rm</b>
           moves files to the Trash.  And going further, on Unix Hotwire integrates closely with other systems programming tools like OpenSSH;
           the <b>ssh</b> builtin allows completion from <tt>known_hosts</tt>, and it is a longer-term goal for Hotwire to provide the best
           possible SSH experience.</p>
