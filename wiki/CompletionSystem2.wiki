#summary Whiteboard for a new completion system

= Need for a new system =

The current system has a number of flaws.

 * It only shows you at most 4 matches, and wastes a lot of horizontal space.
 * You can't click on items to choose.
 * It's constantly trying to complete, but you may want to see what's underneath it.
 * There is no way to have it use more space for when you do want that.

= Initial thoughts =

Initially, completions will be a single line multi-column display.  This will
make them relatively unobtrusive.  When you hit TAB, it gets somewhat larger, perhaps
equivalent to the current size.  

We also want to support a navigation mode where we take up a lot more space.  When you hit TAB TAB in bash, it shows you a big list.  Perhaps the design here overlaps with what we want to fix issue 14.
