#summary Whiteboard for a new completion system

= Need for a new system =

The current system has a number of flaws.

 * It only shows you at most 4 matches, and wastes a lot of horizontal space.
 * You can't click on items to choose.
 * It's constantly trying to complete, but you may want to see what's underneath it.
 * There is no way to have it use more space for when you do want that.

= Completion2 mockups =

Initially, completions will be a single line multi-column display.  This will
make them relatively unobtrusive.  You know how many there are, but don't see a big list.  You can continue to refine the list by typing.  It will update on a timeout (we might want to have a status message for when the completions are stale).

Now, when you hit TAB - if there is only one completion, we choose it.  If all completions have a common prefix, we fill in with that, and recomplete.  This matches `bash`.  If there are ambiguous completions, `TAB` expands the display:
