#summary Contributing to the Hotwire project

= Submitting a patch =

 * First, be sure you've looked at the CodingStyle guidelines.
 * Make changes in a Subversion (or `git-svn`) checkout
 * Use "svn diff" to generate a diff (or `git-svn diff`)
 * Create a new issue in the [http://code.google.com/p/hotwire-shell/issues/list Issue Tracker]
 * Wait for review from one of the current committers, make any changes necessary for review
 * Once complete, a committer will add your patch to Subversion
 
= Committer process =

If you're a committer on the project, welcome!  Largely, the guidelines for committers are
similar to external patches.  This means we would like major changes to be submitted through
the issue tracker so they can be peer-reviewed before commit.

If your patch is "trivial", then you should feel free to commit it 
without review.  Changes which modify under 5-10 lines can be trivial, but are not always.  It
depends on the area of the code.  Use your best judgement.  For example, adding a docstring
never requires review, but adding even a trivial method to a platform interface like
`BaseFilesystem` always does.

Platform maintainers can commit to the implementation files for their platform in `sysdep` without review.
