= Where to Ask Questions =

Hotwire is a young project, so many questions may not have been asked yet.  If you want to ask a question, the best place to do so is on the [http://groups.google.com/group/hotwire-shell/topics discussion group].

= Questions =

== How do I stop a command?  Why doesn't Ctrl-C work? ==

In hotwire you use Ctrl-Shift-C to send a kill signal to a command.  (Ctrl-C is used for copy, as in most other desktop applications).

== Can I start hotwire in a directory other than home? ==

Yes.  Just put the directory at the end of the command for hotwire:

{{{ $ hotwire /path/to/dir/ }}}
