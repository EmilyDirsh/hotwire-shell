#summary Ideas for Hotwire projects

= Project Ideas =

The intent of this page is to be a whiteboard for potential Hotwire improvements that are not yet baked enough to turn into issues.

== HotwireScripting ==

We need to formalize the current Hotwire pipeline language.  See HotwireScripting for the page on this.

== IronPython ===

Would be interesting to try rewriting Hotwire to run on IronPython+Gtk#+Mono rather than CPython+pygtk.  The main motivation for this is to get *real threads*.  We need this in order to be able to execute arbitrary user code without blocking the UI.

== CompletionSystem2 ==

See [CompletionSystem2].

== 100% Terminal Compat ==

Possible idea for killing the hardcoded list of tty apps - if in the initial stream load, we see stuff that looks like terminal codes (which almost certainly isn't valid UTF-8), we create a new VTE window and push that data into it.  This might not even be that hard.  Just use [http://library.gnome.org/devel/vte/unstable/VteTerminal.html#vte-terminal-set-pty vte_terminal_set_pty]?
