#summary Hotwire change log
== Changes in Hotwire 0.590 ==

Visible changes:

 * Better completion of executables in cwd (#83)
 * FilePath listing trims common prefix
 * FilePath listing includes owner/group/permissions
 * Tabs are reorderable via drag and drop (with new enough GTK+)

Notable bugfixes:

 * .desktop file references correct icon
 * Fix race condition in persistence framework (#81)
 * Correctly interrupt entire subprocess group with Cancel/Ctrl-C
 * Window resizing (#80)
 * Completion window should behave better (#88 and others)
 * Fix bold color in term (#85)
 * Start autoscrolling output again if scroll is at end
 * Tab close button draws correctly

== Changes in Hotwire 0.575 ==

Notable bugfixes:

 * Suck in Python 2.5's webbrowser.py so we work better on Python 2.4
 * Include hotwire icon
 * Don't lose on EPIPE from subprocesses
 * Ctrl-c cancel updates statusbar

== Changes in Hotwire 0.567 ==

Visible changes:

 * Support for creating new windows (in addition to new tabs)
 * Ctrl-c now Does The Right Thing; if you have a selection it copies, otherwise cancels last command
 * Tab switching is now Ctrl-# and not Alt-# to match gnome-terminal and Firefox (#74)
 * There is a basic menubar now for some discoverability
 * Alt-Left and Alt-Right keybindings are gone; I want to use these later for directory nav.  Use Ctrl-PageUp/PageDn or Ctrl-# instead.
 * Ctrl-Up and Ctrl-Down are convenient ways to cycle through previous command displays
 * The help display gains a link to the tutorial on the wiki
 * Wrap lines checkbox for unicode renderer (should this be persistent?)
 * `man` and `top` are now run with '''term''' by default
 
Notable bugfixes:
 
 * Headers in '''ls''' display work better (#76)
 * Shell command cancellation works much better now (pid was a global variable, oops!)
 * Some memory usage reduction fixes
 * Completion window hides itself appropriately in more situations now

== Changes in Hotwire 0.556 ==

 * Hotwire keeps track of "hot" working directories and offers them as completions when using 'cd'.
 * Completions now have icons (useful to distinguish real files from history completions)
 * New builtin 'fsearch' is like fgrep -R, but cooler.
 * New builtin 'prop' for accessing object properties
 * The completion window should flash a lot less during completion
 * Escape hides the completion window
 * Fix shell commands using [] and {}
 * Terminal supports copy/paste with Ctrl-Shift-C, Ctrl-Shift-V.
 * Terminal uses system colors and monospace font
 * Terminal closes when command exits
 * Hotwire is now a singleton on Linux (support for new windows coming soon)

== Changes in Hotwire 0.554 ==

 * Native windows installer with no external dependencies on Python or GTK+.
 * Completion engine redone again.  You can now drill down into directories using SHIFT.
 * There is now interactive Firefox-style search over command output.  Try typing Ctrl-s.   Very handy for output of 'make'!
 * 'rm' and friends are implemented for Windows.
 * Default aliases (i.e. 'vi' -> 'term vi', 'ssh' -> 'term ssh').
 * Progress meters for 'rm' and friends.
 * On Linux, 'ls' now shows miniature pixbufs for files (like Nautilus)
 * On Windows, basic icons for files/directories work.
 * 'ls' now has size and last modified date
 * On Linux, 'ls' has right click menu to do 'Open with...', same list as Nautilus
 * 'ls' now requires '-a' to show hidden files
 * Completion window is fixed size so it doesn't go crazy on long commands; this one needs work still.
 * Cancelling shell subprocesses should be more reliable on Unix
 * 'cd' now only offers directories as completions (and infrastructure is there for other command-specific completions)
 * Executable completion handles current directory too (typing ./autogen.sh does the right thing)
 * Better code internally; it should be getting easier to port Hotwire to other platforms like BSD and Mac OS X.
