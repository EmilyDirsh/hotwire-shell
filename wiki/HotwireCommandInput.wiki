#summary How to deal with commands that require input or a real terminal

= Short answer =

Type `term commandname`, for example: `term sudo vi /etc/foo.conf`
Another alternative is to use a GUI version of the command `gksudo`, etc.

= Long answer =

Hotwire is designed with the realization that the vast majority of
commands on Unix simply output text.  So by default, when you run
a system command, we place it into a graphical widget designed just
for viewing text.  The benefits of this are that we can implement search
easily, for example.  

This default mode is called `sh`.  You may notice when you type a command,
it is prefixed with `sh`, for example: `sh /sbin/ifconfig`.  Now, you can
override this and create a terminal tab by typing `term commandname`.  See
the above example.

When you override a command like this, Hotwire remembers it.
For example if you do `term xemacs filename.txt`, from then on you can just
type `xemacs filename.txt`, and Hotwire will automatically prefix it with `term`.
To change back, you can manually prefix the command with `sh` again.  

We're trying to design a better system; but this is the way the current one works.
