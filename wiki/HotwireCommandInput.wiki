#summary How to deal with commands that require input or a real terminal

= Why doesn't my command work? =

Hotwire is not fully command-compatible with a traditional Unix terminal+shell; for more background on this see HotwireVsBinSh.

= How do I make it work? =

If the command requires simple text input, type `Ctrl-I`.  This is sufficient for applications such as the `mysql` and `python` shells.

For real terminal applications (e.g. `top`, `vi`), you can type `term top`.  Hotwire has a [http://hotwire-shell.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/hotwire/sysdep/unix_lateinit.py default list] of terminal applications internally.

_You only need to specify `term` once_; after that, Hotwire will remember to use `term` for that commandname.

Another alternative is to use a GUI version of the command `gksudo`, etc.
