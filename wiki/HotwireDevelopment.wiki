#summary How to develop Hotwire
#labels Featured

= Source Code =

See [http://code.google.com/p/hotwire-shell/source Source page].

= Getting started =

Run this command after having checked out from Subversion or unpacking the Zip file:

{{{
python ui/hotwire
}}}

== Using Hotwire to hack Hotwire ==

Use the ''-n'' option to tell Hotwire not to save anything; this avoids the instances overwriting each
other's history and in the future other things.

{{{
python ui/hotwire -n
}}}

= Architecture =

See HotwireArchitecture for a technical overview.

= Communication =

Discussion happens on the [http://groups.google.com/group/hotwire-shell Hotwire Google Group].
You can send patches or links to cloned trees there, or create a Trac ticket.

= Dependencies =

Hotwire requires [http://python.org Python >= 2.5], [http://pygtk.org PyGTK] at a minimum.

== Linux/Unix ==
On Linux you will want the Python GNOME libraries (`gconf`, `gnomevfs`), though Hotwire should work (with reduced functionality) without them.  You should also have `dbus` installed.

== Windows ==

See HotwireWindows.

= What to hack on? =

DiveIntoHotwireCode is a page dedicated to relatively easy things to start on to get
your feet wet with the Hotwire code.

There is also the full the list of open tickets: {1}
