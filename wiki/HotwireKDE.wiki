#summary Random notes on KDE integration

= What not to do =

Another UI written in Qt isn't that interesting; would be a significant amount of work for almost no real benefit.  But there are definitely useful things we can do to be a better KDE experience:

= Preferred applications =

Would be nice to pick up a KDE user's preferred text editor, for example.  [http://api.kde.org/3.5-api/kdelibs-apidocs/kio/kio/html/classKTrader.html#f317c76b7cfb2a1e8ccc0df72676b2d5 KTrader] looks like the way to do this.

= KDE icons =

Should use the KDE file thumbnailer.
 
= File dialogs =

Right now we don't have any file selectors, so this is moot.
