#summary About Hotwire on Mac OS X

= Summary =

I haven't personally tried running on OS X.  There are two main hurdles that have to be crossed. First, you'll need either Leopard for Python 2.5, or Python 2.4+external sqlite.  Second, you will need a working GTK+ on OS X.  That either means running X, or trying out [http://developer.imendio.com/projects/gtk-macosx Native GTK+ for OS X].
