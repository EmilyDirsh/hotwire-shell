#summary Why Hotwire is not a programming language

If you want to write multi-line scripts with variables, flow control, data structures etc., *write them in Python*.

It may make sense to import Hotwire's command pipeline code for parts of a Python program:

{{{
from hotwire.command import Pipeline

p = Pipeline.parse('ps | filter java cmd')
p.execute()
for result in p.get_output():
  result.kill()
}}}

But this is not really a focus for development.
