#summary Example HotwirePipe commands

= Sample !HotwirePipe commands =

{{{
walk /home/me/Media | py-filter 'it.size > 10**7'
}}}

Find all files in Media bigger than 10 megabytes.

{{{
svn diff
|filter -i frob
}}}

Generate a diff, then find all lines matching "frob" in it.

{{{
proc | filter frob cmd | kill
}}}

Kill all processes (owned by you) with `frob` in their name.  Note that *kill* is smart enough to take *Process* objects on its input.

{{{
walk /home/me/tmp | filter '\\.zip$' basename | prop path | apply rm
}}}

Recursively find all zip files in `/home/me/tmp`, and move them to the trash.  Because *rm* doesn't currently take File objects as input, we convert them to paths, then use the *apply* builtin which is similar to Unix `xargs`.
