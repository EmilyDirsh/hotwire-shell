#summary Ideas about how we could create a Hotwire language

= Creating a variation of Python designed for system scripts =

One major item of feedback from a Hotwire presentation at FOSSCamp 2007 was that we should try to create a language.  It was felt that system scripting in Python wasn't ideal.

Here are some examples from Alexander Larsson about what a Hotwire language could do:

{{{
 There is a set of basic types with things like filename, process, user
 These come in two forms, "references" and "info about" where the later is a "subclass" of the other (i.e. can be used in place of)
 operators:
 | - pipe 
 \ - grep
 () - sub command
 * - "dereference"
 (ie. turn ref object into info
}}}

Examples:

{{{
kill (procs \ user = alex cpu_use > 0.5)
* /tmp
}}}

= Issues =

* How can we take advantage of Hotwire's capability for rich user interaction via the window system?
* How much can we leverage Python (specifically the syntax, the libraries?)
