#summary Comparison between Powershell and Hotwire

Hotwire steals !PowerShell's idea of pipelining objects, not byte streams (HotwireArchitecture).

However, that's about where the similarities end.  Some important differences:

 * Hotwire is not interested in becoming a full-fledged scripting language, especially not one with lots of "${}.%" - see HotwireNotLanguage
 * Hotwire aims for a much richer default user experience.  There are the obvious things like using icons and having clickable links, but besides that Hotwire's client requires a window system and a canvas; commands and renderers can assume they exist.
