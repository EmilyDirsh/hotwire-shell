#summary Hotwire on Windows


The Windows port is in fairly decent shape now.

= Getting a development environment setup =

== Python Downloads ==

 * [[http://python.org/download/ Python]].  Get the MSI.
 * [[http://python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/Downloads.html Python Win32 Extensions]].  Follow the link to Sourceforge.  You need to match the extension installer version to your Python version; at the time of this writing current Python is 2.5, so you'd download '''pywin32-210.win32-py2.5.exe'''.

== PyGTK ==

There are a few choices here; I used the [[http://live.gnome.org/PyGTK/FAQ/Win32AndPygtk PyGTK FAQ]] instructions, but
there is work on a [[http://aruiz.typepad.com/siliconisland/2007/05/tango_and_gtk_l.html new PyGTK installer]].

You can initially run Hotwire from cmd.exe or powershell.exe as you choose.  I use
[ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/ Emacs] for development, but of course there are hundreds of other choices.
Here's my setup for Powershell:

{{{
$env:path += ';C:\Python25'
cd My Documents\hotwire
python ui/hotwire
}}}

= Building an installer =

Just now got [[http://www.py2exe.org/ Py2exe]] to work.  In particular see [[http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/Py2exeAndPyGTK Py2exe PyGTK page]].

== Initial setup ==

{{{
mkdir dist
}}}

Copy the `lib` and `etc` directories from `C:\Program Files\Common Files\GTK\2.0` into the new `dist` directory.

== Running py2exe ==

{{{
python setup.py py2exe
}}}
